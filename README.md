# haarcascade_Algorithm_Projects
 Beginner friendly and Algorithmic Approach of Machine Learning with haarcascade Algorithm in OpenCV (Python)

Basically it uses pre-trained haarcascade models to track down face properties from an image with the help of haar models 
for advance learning (https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html)
